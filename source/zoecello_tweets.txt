It's beautiful @amandapalmer. Hurts too but that's what art is for. https://t.co/Hj79S702ca
Here it is,"Bigger on the Inside" a new song from @amandapalmer, featuring moi on cello. I dare you not to cry &gt; http://t.co/0KMButEjXE
Todays the day... #TheReturned premiers on @AETV. You can hear what I've been up to musically for the last few months
@djspooky I love @womadelaide. That is going to be amazing. Good luck!
so @AmandaPalmer 's latest song #BiggerontheInside comes out today on Patreon. I  played cello on it.
@amandapalmer today's the day right? #biggerontheinside
I hardly ever get reviewed so I emailed this review of my NYC show to Jeff &amp; then realized he'll never read it http://t.co/GUxBhLiFOp

@amandapalmer I've always wanted to play the cello inside a Tardis

Just now seeing all your messages. Thank you.
I knew it was coming but nothing prepares you for having your heart ripped out. And now to witness as our son begins to understand...
Not enough pictures... because Jeff was always the one with camera. Here are a few recent ones &gt; http://t.co/L0gyEWYxOx
It happened this morning. Jeff Rusch, beloved husband, father &amp; friend, left this world. Thanks for sharing the last 17 years with me.
@kyle_list sooperlooper!
@damiansinclair I love the way he is holding up that leaf for privacy
kittens. more kittens.
no sympathy yet. send your good vibes! thanks and luv, xoxoxxo z
What's up with us? "Home Hospice", that's what. Love to you all, Z
@LPdevotii hugs to you too my dear, xoxoxox z
Sorry @jamesmeade13 &amp; others, I didn't know my iTunes contract had expired in Europe. My albums should reappear on iTunes tomorrow!
I didn't know what day it is. It is pancake day! It is not too late for pancakes.

@vampandora I know. Gutted.
@victorybyname yes, @AETV #TheReturned is a remake of the French show. It's different though. I love that orig @mogwai soundtrack too!
The score for The Returned is all done. You can hear what @jeffrusso and I did on March 9 on @AETV &gt; http://t.co/AMsrLtcerH

@just_DeAnn hugs and strength to you during your treatment too xoxox z
Doing the daily radiation run. The radiation takes 15 minutes but the round trip takes 4hrs. Grueling for both of us.
Yes, this is what feet are for in our house &gt; @HUMANWINE: http://t.co/Cx80TiLDDB
@johntmarohn it's all silliness.
@HUMANWINE lol!
Felizes para Sempre is airing in Brazil and it's got my music in it (did you know my grandpa was born in Sao Paulo?) http://t.co/81uoqX6IXx
@johntmarohn and if I don't participate in music key youtube will stop me from monetizing the 10,000 user videos with my music in them.
@johntmarohn I've always used streaming as free advertising but I shouldn't be forced to upload all my content to participate.
@csdaley thanks Chris. so do you, so do you, sir
@NeuroticVows isn't there? More cello! More cellists!!
I would write more on this YouTube stuff but helping my hubby through whole brain radiation requires all my attention. Thnx for the support
Jeff gave me this totally cool necklace last night. Made of silicone. http://t.co/3P7mQQhNth
@neilhimself All I did was write a blog or two ;-)
@thetrichordist I still haven't heard from google directly, or gotten a new contract with those new terms they referenced in billboard
ya'll are very sweet. thank you
@JTVDigital and those 250,000 monthly YouTube views only net around $175 each month
@JTVDigital maybe it would be a loss for others but not for me. Streaming is at most 3% of my sales revenue each year
@SomaFmRusty that article is a bit strong but it's true I've not heard from YouTube directly or gotten an updated contract
.@JTVDigital I will await my new-updated-as-of-last-week contract before making any decisions ;-)
@JTVDigital but it's all still unknowns. What youtube said in @billboardbiz does not match my contract or what they've said for a year
@JTVDigital I can block all 10,000 videos with a few clicks in ContentID
@JTVDigital I don't have all my music on any streaming service. Never have. It should be my choice. That's the crux of it.
@JTVDigital that's what I'll be doing, all 10k of them. if I can't monetize videos, neither can YouTube
@cortneyharding my partner agreement was setup to monetize those 10k 3rd party videos but now I have to be part of a new music service too
@cortneyharding and now YouTube has linked ContentID to MusicKey, not for my benefit, but so they can compete with Spotify
@cortneyharding not for 10,000 videos. I'm "participating" whether or not agreements are signed.
@chaoszine less than Spotify, but it is hard to say because it is a fractional division of an unknown aggregate number
Linking ContentID to MusicKey = Instant mega catalog w mandatory label participation! It's a land grab to be the next default music service.
Did I put those 10,000 videos on Youtube? No. I'm participating whether I like it or not. http://t.co/AgqpvCGyTw
ContentID was made to solve a problem that Youtube created, to suddenly link participation w/ a new music streaming service is lame.
one issue with the "you don't have to sign" argument is an artists music is on youtube whether they like it or not. @cortneyharding
Oh, terrible illness. I would not wish you on my worst enemies. #fuckcancer
.@stuartdredge new blog forthcoming when I have a moment
.@stuartdredge as far as I can tell that is still true, unless they just instructed their rep to say that for kicks
.@stuartdredge yeah that part. The rep told me any videos I upload would be blocked and I have to make a new channel
.@stuartdredge I know I can participate in contentid w/out monetization, but that blocking my videos part...did that evaporate?
.@stuartdredge I've been in cancer land, did I miss where YouTube said they will not actually block my channel?
.@stuartdredge but it won't, this YouTube stuff is only a topic of interest in our music industry ghetto
@stuartdredge I have to think up something really good!
@artistempathy that really made me smile, thank you ;-)
@seanrgarland thanks for saying that!
Patently patronized
What do you think, is this clarified for you? "Youtube's terms for artists, clarified" http://t.co/J2TUQqaYmJ
@thelightinlife totally agree!!
@sxipshirey recording the conversation would have been illegal, it's a transcript
@thelightinlife that's all I've got so far, google is communicating via the press

@BoydMulterer thank you, very much appreciated and I hope you enjoy it!
@AdamsLisa got it, thanks
.@AdamsLisa thanks much. He definitely needs WBR, I'm just looking for a facility that is familiar with hippocampal sparing
Re: removal of music links in knowledge graph @starbuck5250, I expect it's not a bug but a feature we don't understand yet
Yet again, I am a snuggie
@SomaFmRusty I'm thinking about just letting them block me. The money is tiny and not worth getting my knickers in a knot
@SomaFmRusty except that everything I upload for contentid matching goes in the service, along w user uploads with me in the description
Hope this clears things up, a transcript of my conversation with YouTube http://t.co/tzUsCznTXp
@mmasnick thanks for the post, I agree, would just a little more more flexibility really be so onerous for @Google?

@BurlyQEinstein if it's not too awkward, yes please!
@Meehaul thank you!
@dietgrapes sorry! hopefully I'll have more happy things to tweet bout soon
Twitterpeeps, I need your help. My husband needs whole brain radiation. I'm looking for a facility that will do hippocampal-avoidance
The word "progression" used to make me think of Wagner. It means something entirely different now that I am the wife of a cancer patient.
@Theremina @rstevens I think I could be happy if the internet only consisted of pictures like this and nothing else.
ponticello is back
. @littlefluffycat ;-) it's something I often joke about when the music needs something I can't identity..."More cowbell!"
@bluezander hm. Let's see what I've got here...
.@SomaFmRusty many things sound awesome slowed down! There is a lot of slowed scratchy cello &amp; scraped cheese grater in The Returned score.
I'm working on the last episode of The Returned this week. I've yet to use a cowbell in the score. There is still time.
@tubefilter exactly. If you don't agree to those terms, they will block your channel
YouTube says Any artist who agrees to our basic Terms of Service will always be able to share videos" i.e any artist who doesn't, won't.
@geraniumkate be careful with that cat food ;-)
@Vinumguy a day later the metro north reopened and I evacuated campus for a friend's apartment in the city.
@Vinumguy agreed. I remember an SLC year where I stayed for spring break and we were snowed in...
@coreyschreppel just a wee bit cold!

On top of everything else...our old VW died last week &amp; needs a new engine and the new VW just got a flat tire. Thanks! Stop now, ok?
@whittles oh no! I hope the driver stopped to help??
@DrJamesPrescott yes. nothing available right now for lung cancer PIK3CA
I'm too tired to fight and am just letting the little person stay up. "You love sleeping Mama, I love to stay up all night". Yup.
It says something about an industry when telling the truth is news.
Whenever I hear someone say "monetize it!" I imagine the Portlandia sketch "Put a bird on it!"

@Vinumguy 2nd week of May, Gods willing

If you're coming to any of my NYC shows.....heads up that I will play early. Show starts at 8pm. Meet &amp; greet afterwards at 9:30.
@quicksilver0225 I have been working hard every day and night, but on music for a TV show. Almost done with that.....
@iLikehurley no offense taken! I enjoy everyone's opinions and wit on twitter. happy new year to you!

@allartburns you're welcome ;-) thanks for listening
@vlad6benz the doctors office says they are not allowed to use email! Fax or snail mail only. It's astonishing
In other news, Alex picked up the Batmobile lost a wheel version of jingle bells and is singing it nonstop. ;-)
Gosh, so many new projects I want to work on: electronic medical records, health insurance reform, a symphony....
I also carry my husband's advanced directive, permission thingy in my purse. Makes no difference, still med centers can't share records.
Yeah yeah HIPPA HIPPA. But when the patient is onsite and you still can't link to digital records from a related facility? Hello Kafka
@BillStewart415 I get the privacy but when the patient is there to approve &amp; the medical cntr is the same system it shouldn't be so hard!
#callmecrazy
If we can email a wrench to the ISS surely medical providers in the same system, on the same block, can share digital records?
.@nickdawson I'm hoping digital medical records is a problem Apple can solve ;-)
@nickdawson I have it all on dropbox,  disks and a USB stick too, but medical providers say they can't use it, or don't know how. 2014, not!
@nickdawson and instead i had to relate all the details of a complex medical case. lots of room for error!
@nickdawson our situation was a hospital in the same medical group, who could not access my husband's medical records.
@kmcgivney I have osirix! great tool
@kmcgivney yup!
.@kmcgivney i have all my husband's data on a USB stick but medical institutions say they can't use it for technical and/or legal reasons
@kmcgivney sorry to hear about your illness. do you find medical offices accept your digital records?

@pierrotechnique I don't feel any pressure to be better or worse or similar. I've been pretty free to do my own thing. It's great.
@pierrotechnique gosh, I feel no pressure whatsoever in that regard. What @mogwaiband did for the French version is totally unique.
I sure do enjoy composing for The Returned. Previously dead people are so inspiring.
@YanaYans pancakes? ;-)
I think this holiday season I will buy nothing but art, directly from artists...but please don't email me about it ;-)

@Acoustic_Labs a little small to play the cello in! My studio is plenty quiet...just in the middle of a damp forest ;-)
I need to heat up my studio to lower the humidity so the cello doesn't sound so much like, um, farts.
. @toayc This cello has always had a hard time "speaking" when the air is humid. And this redwood forest is humid in the winter!
I just can't record cello on rainy days. Too wolfy and muffled.

@stuartdredge 1) we already know spotify isn't a great deal for the artistic middle class, maybe it's not good for royalty either.
@autojim would have been a great protest idea: "You might need an ID to vote but you don't need pants"

I was just on @questCNN talking about Spotify and Taylor Swift. But now, back to work on The Returned! Music for another episode to finish.

@Gaz0line just like lung cancer....I think because both aren't discovered until stage IV
@Gaz0line just pointing out the numbers.
@Gaz0line exactly. that's why i posted the info i just found.
@Gaz0line The 2 columns aren't necessarily the same people: annual rates &amp; annual deaths, so making them % of each other wouldn't be correct
@Gaz0line that 9% is a percentage of ALL cancer deaths. i'll add that to the spreadsheet!
Here's a fun spreadsheet (not!): annual cancer rates, deaths and funding percentages. http://t.co/irv4TTr5wm
@LPdevotii hope the bronchitis clears up soon
@redgoldeden thanks and good night!
@JuliusTheOrange perhaps both
@LPdevotii I do...HOURS OF MUSIC.... but in a different format. I'm composing for the show The Returned, which airs in Jan on A&amp;E.

@LPdevotii large hug! thanks ;-)
Nudity. That's the ticket!! Artists in clear plastic raincoats for lung cancer awareness. You're welcome. #LCAM14
Or, maybe I could help the cause by taking a pic of myself wearing nothing but a clear plastic raincoat? ;-) #LCAM14
Maybe just #clear for lung cancer awareness month? It's probably something already though. (#LCAM14)
@mattwarren did you get an answer? ;-)
searching just now on Twitter, a lot of breathing hashtags are about vaping or air pollution. (re, lung cancer awareness month)
Lung cancer's color? Clear. So wear your transparent plastic Blade Runner replicant raincoats this month to show your support.
Twitter, I call upon your collective genius: a sexy hashtag for lung cancer awareness month (i.e. #LCAM14)?  I've drawn a blank.
Did you know lung cancer awareness month starts tomorrow? Nope, me neither. #LCAM14 is the hashtag. Um, Large Carrier Amplitude Modulation?

Trying to be helpful and use my distant memory of pregnancy-induced nausea to help Jeff with his  radiation-induced nausea. Vaguely helpful.
He's an old black lab, this dog who somehow managed to get to our house w a broken leg. He was very hungry and thirsty. I'm hanging with him
Today's adventures include a whimpering, neglected stray dog with a badly broken leg. Poor guy is really suffering.

@Bigwobbles do you? I haven't noticed!! Like all your messages, thank you ;-)
@chrisleiker or, if a provider bills more than the insurance company allows, the patient has to pay the difference &amp; it doesn't count to OOP
@chrisleiker it is supposed to be 10k a year, but if something is "not covered" is doesn't count towards your out of pocket max
@autojim legs...superfluous appendages! sheesh
@autojim for us that's been things like genetic testing of the tumor, more MRIs than allowed, pins to hold his leg together, etc...
@autojim that's the dirty little secret of health insurance, if they deny something, it doesn't go towards your OOP.
@autojim we did, but a lot of treatments "aren't covered" and so they don't count toward OOP.
But holy cow. $479,218 for 4 months of cancer treatment? Wow.
Tallied the medical bills since Jeff's diagnosis: $479,218. So far we've been *only* had to pay 6% of that so I guess insurance is working!
My hubby had pins in his broken leg at in-network hospital but apparently surgeon was out of network. #notcovered http://t.co/8ILe4gl6g0
@MusingsbyEliza try that maybe? it's ridiculous we have to do that. most people don't bother and then anthem doesn't have to pay
@MusingsbyEliza I've have gotten these visits covered by calling Anthem and then having the doctor resubmit the bill with a different code
This sounds really good: "Artists Raising Kids: Thoughts on how to have it all" a webinar from @creativecap on Sep 29 http://t.co/DGtbrwUZxi
@MusingsbyEliza I've never gotten them to cover a "well visit". As soon as you talk to the doctor about anything it's an office visit!
@Bigwobbles yes, someday there will be time to watch dr who! I am so many seasons behind!
@Bigwobbles alas one of my loved ones can't drink wine now and the other one is too young!
Other families undergoing cancer know what I mean: occasionally you realize that you haven't relaxed since the diagnosis.
Wish we could have a week off without cancer. Some days it is all a bit much. Wee bit of wine and romping with #cellokid helps.

His primary lung tumor is 10-15% of its former self (was 9cm). Lymph nodes resolved. Other lung spots gone. Brain mets all smaller some gone
Jeff is doing great by the way and is here at #SAS14. He just had chemo #5 and is tired but the CT last week showed his cancer is tiny.

@TaniaLombrozo loved the blog ;-)
@TaniaLombrozo there is probably a German word for that feeling when you go to drink your 2nd cup of tea and realize you've drunk it ;-)
@TaniaLombrozo I think I tweet that way when I can't find an appropriate word to describe the described feeling....

What am I thinking? I should not bring #watermelonsalad to the preschooler party. I should juice the watermelon and mix it with vodka.
Preschooler birthday picnic today. I'm tempted to make a watermelon salad just to spite myself (see yesterday's tweets)
@masonbates tomato water ????!!!! explain yourself sir
@AspenJuly that's cool ;-) weren't a choice for us here in Northern California.
I'm having a hard time with the watermelon-in-a-savory-salad concept.
It's been interesting the last few months to discover what my go to stress food is: cabbage. Could be worse.
@ThatNeilGuy yup
Here's how it goes: oncologist order test/med/etc, Anthem deny, test/med delayed, spend hrs on phone, approved. Is it like this for you too?
Here's a crazy idea. Anthem, when my hubby's doc orders meds or a procedure, how about you just approve it?

Digital health records. Please. I am so tired of reciting Jeff's history to every damn medical professional so they can write it down again.
This time I'm prepared to stay overnight at the hospital. I have my own pillow, a camping mattress and a bottle of rye.

Malfunctioning hydraulic bits mean I can't get to Rochester tonight. I can't miss my flight back with #cellokid though, so redeye for me :-(
Last time I flew Delta a mechanical problem almost had me miss my concert in Atlanta. Today I'm trying to pick up #cellokid at Granny's
As I've mentioned before. It is fucking impossible to get to western NY state.
Something about a malfunctioning hydrolic bit? That sounds important! Good call pilot. I'm 1000% happy to wait for that to get fixed! #delta

Deer, if you dare eat from the tray of wheatgrass on my back deck, I am going to eat you. Clear?
@cajunjoel having a little weep here. thank you! long hug, z

what does my guy have? stage 4 non-small-cell adenocarcinoma, and no he has never smoked and has been vegetarian since he was 11! #unfair
I'm gathering second opinions on my husband's cancer treatment. If there is a lung cancer oncologist you would recommend, send their name!
@cratic totally! thank you ;-)
Oh, poison oak too!? you had to appear now, did you?
Hugs to all you carers out there. I get it now. This is hard work. #fuckcancer
@composerAnne curiously, they do not!
holy cow, the amount of conflicting information about what to feed cancer patients undergoing chemo.  #overwhelmed
@colemanhall ;-)
@autojim missed that one!
thanks folks. night night, z
@AndrewJanke omg. that's the ticket.
@MisterManny nice, sir. (doffs hat)
@Wzzy lol, I am now. thanks ;-)
@AnnieneStockton I remember!
What helps me these days? Groan-worthy jokes and pictures of baby animals, and if you see me in person feel free to bear hug me.
Yeah, cancer f-ing sucks and I'm scared but I still love your horrible jokes. Send em'!!!!
@Theremina back at ya! hugs and smooches are pretty much the most important things around, i've learned
@nadya thank you nadya. kisses and hugs your way too, z
I find myself unable to read or watch anything. Twitter surfing and getting snippets of other peoples 'normal' lives is oddly comforting.
At last, peace in the house &amp; nothing pressing to do.
@lucaskrech bad jokes perhaps? xoxoxox, z
@brettglass I will!
By the way, humor is good. Your jokes, even extremely bad, distasteful and truly groan-worthy ones, are very welcome ;-) #fuckcancer
We are 4 days into chemo. We are going to kick cancer's ass. It will be sorry.
Yesterday we came home. Jeff is enjoying naps in the hammock, soaks in the hot tub, the sound of birds &amp; the embrace of family....
There is no place like home.

@wilw Word. Oh, look! An ant!
@outwardfacing yes, we're doing that!
@johnwashburn exactly, there wouldn't be any trickle down effect! #cry
.@sfranzese I have a grandfathered plan that would be illegal to sell now, for good reason I see now! it doesn't cover anything
@solobasssteve sigh.
.@solobasssteve I have a feeling Anthem's refusal to cover any medical bills is directly related to their CEO making $17 million last year
@solobasssteve i hope so too! figured out from the fine print of our insurance that nothing that happens outside a hospital is covered :-(
thank goodness for @EmrgencyKittens: http://t.co/6e9YQe7w44

@ELEMENTARYStaff  I need to get you guys my new music.

Ok yeah. I could get used to having a limo take me everywhere.
@Jaredmackley alas no. I played for 5 minutes last night at the premier of Penny Dreadful. On my way home now.

Hello NYC! Spring looks good on you.
@dietgrapes nope not me! Maybe they are just fans ;-)
@allenwentz grandfathered anthem plan from 2010
One thing at a time. I'm off for a stroll around Boulder and then a glass of wine. I fly to NYC in the morning to play at a TV show premier.
@konanut thank you!
It's appalling. We purchased an Anthem plan that we thought covered the family. Apparently it covers 100% of nothing. False advertising.
@BHBT anthem blue cross, ppo plan
Anthem fine print: "No benefits are provided for services or supplies such as, but not limited to:" list-of-every-possible-medical-procedure
I think I just discovered that the fine print of our health plan with Anthem says that no medical services are actually covered.
@mpressmeredith looked it up! apparently if they say the call will be recorded, you can record too!
@mpressmeredith it's the only way I can keep the information straight. they record the call too, is the law just that i have to tell them?
If you are self-employed and disputing a claim with your health insurance, put the phone on speaker and record every call. #advice
@nattylongshot it will be broadcast in august I think. Not for a while!
Just taped a show over at Boulder's eTown. Half of a show with the Lumineers. What a cool operation they have going on. Solar powered too!
wake up, Z, wake up!
@holly_heffel i'm still laughing about that one. told him and he had a good laugh too ;-) thanks for coming to the show
Octopus salad, gnocchi with nettle pesto and something called "eton mess". Wake me up next week.  #boulder
whipped cream and meringue
@Vinumguy I always think of Mork, but now boulder is the land of gnocchi with nettle pesto!
@MisterManny just in boulder ;-)
Na nu na nu
I meant to have a hike in the flatirons today, but it was too hot and I, um, ate and drank all day instead. #dayoff
Boulderites, good grief you have a lot of amazing restaurants. I've done nothing but eat today. Right now I'm at The Kitchen.
#nap
@OldMiner hm.... Possible
Yup, this is what artists do backstage: part hair on left. Part hair on right. Part hair on left. Sweep hair to front. Part hair on right...
I cannot decide what side to part my hair on for this Boulder show.
@ZaneSelvans smooch ;-)

Na nu na nu! Hi Boulder. Just enough time for a nap before soundcheck. Partying Berkshire Hathaway people kept me up all night in Omaha.
@jgpmolloy nicely done sir ;-)
Last night I accidentally brought a grocery list onstage instead of a set list. Feta, asparagus, milk, black beans....
@JoeJoestock don't forget the asparagus !
Flying to Denver. See you soon Boulder!
Thanks to everyone from Omaha and beyond who came to the show last night &amp; thanks to the Holland Center for inviting me.

Quinoa feta stuffed peppers, spring veggies with lemony sauce, chocolate mousse....forgive me if I play all my songs slowly tonight.
Time to wake up the hair
@Vinumguy sept or October for Texas I think. But I'm winging it
@Vinumguy Evan, just realized it's you! Hey there!! You're on.....diva lessons ;-)
I'm not sure I should have eaten chocolate mousse BEFORE the show. Now I have no incentive. I am complete.

@kevsmusic yes, until they do the same thing! i didn't want to spread myself too thin, but it's more appealing now
Any other artists thinking about abandoning Facebook now that they've throttled organic reach for Pages?
So gorgeous outside today. Trying to burn it into my eyeballs. Don't worry, I won't look directly at the sun.
@kristy yup. i have to drive several miles east to get a cell signal. and comcast is the only internet provider
It's coming but for now, rural areas like mine don't have the infrastructure for everyone to stream all their media.
I don't think streaming is for rural folks. No cell service &amp; the Comcast "Blast" me and my neighbours have is often less than 100 kbps
@supdegrave you are more than welcome sir ;-)

@Bigwobbles well that is better than I could do on that song. i like it when you start dancing
@Bigwobbles OMG That is you!!!! awesomeness. thanks for sending
I tried to make videos of my process &amp; discovered it was too long &amp; non-linear. And I couldn't work when observed. I'm like an electron.
@rubyist I started making videos &amp; realized my process was too long &amp; non-linear and then i couldn't do it when i was being filmed!
@PeterHollens great feedback. thanks peter
@StephenSimmons I try to be firm, but I always give in
@NickThayer I'd like to release that music too, the planetarium stuff I did
@rstevens that's an interesting one. it's just me most of the time, so no i don't record sound checks. i should get a mini stand and video
@coreyschreppel yes, hearing that as well. thanks
@anths oh yeah, Zoe at Work. where did the time go!!?? i forgot about it
cello karaoke, there's an idea.
@rstevens well, regardless of where this crowdfunding nonsense goes, i think you should make some cello ninja socks
managing yourself does not always work
.@rstevens I could offer custom socks for each song! One can never have too many after all.
@anths yes. good point
@bilborg the problem is that I think my work doesn't make sense until it is polished. i do post some works in progress to soundcloud though
@wjohnstweet  how to license those loops is the issue that keeps holding things up.
Yes, I know. It's amazing I've been able to get this far really.
I mean, new music is a given. There will be lots for anyone who wants it. But what ELSE is interesting to you? I have not a clue
What do you want from me? I am taking requests as I consider my album release. Um, clean requests ;-)
@mmasnick god, please do. I get what seems like an email a day, and I do have an impending album release ;-)
Is there anything interesting about me or my music that you'd like access to? variations of each song? my process? I have not the slightest.
So many people tell me I should crowdfund yet I continue to resist. But if I did...patreon, pledgemusic, kickstarter?? your thoughts welcome

My cello, my computer and I are practicing for the premier of Boulders &amp; Bones with @ODCsf  on Thursday.
It's no use Putin, I still think you're chinless
@SunByrne I'm recording some things at 24/48 and some at 24/88. 88 brings my computer to a halt with more than 8 tracks
@SunByrne I'm working with a ballet right now. Will get back to the album after. Maybe in June/July? Thank you :-)
@SunByrne the composers who told me said they were asked to make something that "sounds like" me. Guess that's nice ;-)
@SunByrne it's happened a few times, a composer being asked to copy me for TV. I guess I should be flattered but i would rather be hired ;-)
@SunByrne well I know that composer was explicitly hired to copy me for a movie couple years back. I'll have to watch. Which episode ?
@SunByrne nope
I'm really hoping this is the year I learn what the question is. #bigbang

@DDMikeWard it does. but from what I've heard, that might be what makes my performances so special ;-)
And if I'm listening to music I really, really like, I get very still. You could probably empty my pockets and I wouldn't notice.
Even some of my favorite songs, it was sometimes years before I realized what the words were. #musicbrain
It's been annoying to some I've worked with that I'm really into their music but don't have the slightest idea what they are singing about.
@mattyrobs1010 yup!
I'm the opposite. When I hear music I it takes over my brain and I stop understanding words in conversations. http://t.co/DiEESQYweN

@Wzzy odd, sometimes I see "hide all from (annoying site here)" and sometimes no. I found a story that had it and clicked. Fingers crossed!
@Wzzy you know, I don't have that as an option when some posts a buzzfeed story and it appears in my news feed.
@mpanighetti thank you
@Wzzy wait, there is a way to hide buzzfeed etc? I will investigate
@Zahradnik that would be a great feature !!
Dear Facebook Friends, FYI, I am never again clicking on a buzzfeed, upworthy, salon, clickbait link. Thank you.

@nattylongshot I don't know what the film was but it happens all the time. Lots of people put it in their films and 'forget' to ask ;-)
I'm de-digitizing.
I realized that I get such pleasure reading the physical Sunday paper. So I've stopped reading the NYTimes online so as not to ruin it.

@nattylongshot I'm curious though, was it one of those wacky youtube docs or from a legit source?
@nattylongshot nope! Oh well....
@Bigwobbles but thank you. I really appreciate it.
@Bigwobbles so all is good, they did ask. I just didn't know the name of the film. The director I remember though
@Bigwobbles i take that back. I did tell them they would use it! Is it any good?
@Bigwobbles lol, that is optimist! Is this a movie that is out ? They certainly didn't ask
@Bigwobbles hm, I've not heard of it!
@kgcab ok, got it! Do you think this is smoke and mirrors then? I believed it! http://t.co/A0Q3LS0MOl

@sfranzese true! although we're outside the bay area air quality district and it doesn't apply. as a result, boy does it get smoky here
It's a rainy day, the power is out, the big people have colds and the little person has pink eye...but we're all cozy by the fire.
.@mmasnick Although, I guess I'm doing the same thing: I'm using my numbers to tell the story that a niche music career is still possible.
.@mmasnick I haven't released a new album in 3.5 years, so any sales might be considered a bonus at this point.
.@mmasnick Tell me about it. It's like politics, people look at numbers and see what they want to see.

Like everything these days response to my annual sales/streaming report is polarized. Half think it's appalling &amp; half think it's fantastic.
@brianlong absolutely! Write me at info@zoekeating.com and we can set something up
Night night everyone. Sleep well.
@Quinny333 I don't know. But it's inevitable! Every artist has to find their own way to make it all work.
@JammingEcono and my shows are small. i play for 200 to 500 people in each city.
@JammingEcono arts venues are different. not as much $ as rock clubs! for that omaha show i will make 4k no matter how many come
.@JammingEcono yes, that is true in some genres but not all. I have a young child and don't tour much. I use touring for promo
@JaySaysOhWell i know, they have a messy history that i'm gleefully mostly unaware of
@JammingEcono For concert tickets, I don't think an 80% split to the artist is typical at my level. For me it is more like 50-70%
@JammingEcono There is no ticket revenue or licensing revenue in that spreadsheet. It is just sales and streaming.
A great way to freak myself out is to look up through the skylight at the giant trees swaying over the house in the wind. Don't do that.

If an entire pot of tea and 2 cups of coffee and a bacon sandwich don't work, I don't know what else will.
I love, love, love that my music is sometimes bumper music on @NPR @MorningEdition. So does my mother.
@nathanggraves production music? don't know what that is! i do a lot of licensing if that's what you mean. superbowl ad, for example.
@alansky Yes, we do hear that a lot but it's never been true for me though. I have a young child and don't tour much.
@jeffpstonecarve of course. i just need to master the thing. sooooon!
@QueenSerenity42 that is very sad!
@alansky revenue from concerts? i suppose i could, just more work. i just don'y send myself neat statements like the music services do

@_katie_lane thanks for asking that question. but yes. apple keeps 30% of every sale. bandcamp keeps 10%
@SomaFmRusty thanks, checking out now!
@SomaFmRusty since 2010 itunes has let me work with them directly. i pulled my albums out of cdbaby and re-upload them
@SomaFmRusty thank god i can be lame about so much and continue to get away with this
@SomaFmRusty i do record a lot of live performances. they're sitting on a drive, un-listened to. i'm lame.
@SomaFmRusty no reason at all. just never got a digital distributor for anything after 2010. keep meaning to! i'll get one for the next opus
@band_auditor yup, we're pretty different! luckily the ecosystem is diverse &amp; works for both of us. my #s for 2013 &gt; http://t.co/lTb3u2ADi9

Speaking of dance, that's what I'm working on right now: music for @ODCsf. I'll be playing live with them March 20-30 http://t.co/jr9oE8DIJv
I seem to be most popular in the modern dance world though. Youtube CMS turns up 1000's of videos of dance performances using my music.
@artfuture I actually looked at @cutecircuits online last yr wondering if I could sync clothes to music, but figured I couldn't afford them
@BobMarse @artfuture There are many Youtube videos of fashion shows using my music. None of them ever ask: http://t.co/3jLw9gxklX
@JessMuonio It's cool but the style is a bit too fairy for my taste.
.@artfuture surely, someday, one of the many fashion designers who uses my music in their show will send me a dress in exchange

@jschiefer hey there, i'm in studio lock-down and not reading all my email. i'll check!
@BeatsMusicHelp yup, thanks! and thanks @boomcat. Now, on to actually using it....
I do love my illegal character.
.@Boomcat my first itunes submission in 2005 was auto-rejected for 5 months because of my beloved umlaut (or diaeresis, if you will).
@indiequick there isn't a lot of choice. #artistlink is the only way to link merch to Spotify and Beatmusic.
@Boomcat Was trying to hook up artistdirect to my @bandcamp but that's not going so well. I'll come back to it tomorrow. Thanks!
@indiequick hate to pull that one. you should never have to be famous to get stuff to work!
@Boomcat thank you sir
@indiequick and my music is already up there. it was the dots over my e that caused the problem!
@indiequick they won't work with me. no classical. been that way for years.
.@Boomcat thank you! I'm always happy to be a character normalization test case!
No linking to @bandcamp downloads w/ @topspin either: "Invalid offer type: For @Spotify the desc needs to reference physical merch for sale"
I tried to use @topspin to link to @bandcamp. Nope. "Invalid offer type: Digital only downloads on @BeatsMusic must link to iTunes"
@csdaley machines have been trying to obliterate my umlaut for years
I DO exist, I DO!!!
I tried to link up my merch to @beatsmusic and @spotify using the new @topspin artistlink, but it says I don't exist. Anyone else succeed?
@SomaFmRusty I was excited to try it out. What's funny is that I followed a link in an email they sent me to link up my merch.
Just tried to hookup merch on @spotify w/ @topspin but "Your promotion was rejected bc you don't have any music on Spotify" I beg to differ!
@ReubenFaulkner2 perhaps best to stay in!

@AndrewJanke that's exactly what Google links to, except that someone else put it up there.
@nancybaym or I'll just add my own music with image placeholders to youtube.
I don't watch music videos either. I prefer to LISTEN to music. #oldfart
@nancybaym so far only placeholder videos with ads on them ;-) i could care less about video, that's the problem. i don't watch them.
I've resisted. Google's search changes might force me to start making videos so I can have my own work show up 1st in the rankings.
I seem to be the only artist to achieve any kind of success w/out ever having made a video.
@kgcab i believe it's all in service of their subscription service rolling out shortly
@kgcab http://t.co/8Cvg1JwCGy
@kgcab it's also something they just changed recently, putting music "videos" on youtube ahead of artist sites
@farzinothecat VPN is your friend. Tunnelbear, etc
@kgcab I disagree, but it is blog worthy...later!
@kgcab exactly, the original source of the song. i put it there first, others copied it and put it on youtube ;-)
@kgcab but it's self reinforcing. they link to their video first, people link to it
@stevenmcooper I'm not earning money on those plays actually.
@kgcab My understanding of search results is that the top is supposed to be the most authoritative

I used to think criticism was luddite conspiracy theory but @google does indeed weight search result in their favor. I'm a perfect example.

Taking the advice of @Afolox, I just went outside in my pajamas and did a little rain dance. I hope that helps end the #california #drought.
I totally unaware of the mess in Atlanta until now. Holy cow.
C'mon rain, you can do it!! Stop holding on. Just let yourself fall from the sky!!

@flight404 so do I. Where can we perform this that has a full stage screen?
Some things are universal.
I don't consider myself a religious person, but I was moved by this sermon from @jimwallis at #WEF2014 http://t.co/anseqiFBAC
Thank you ;-)
OMG #cellokid #meltdown #tempertantrum. Mum, come back!!

Thanks Mum for holding down the fort with #cellokid all week and making our trip to @Davos #wef2014 possible!!
@knobody EXACTLY
No crashing allowed for me! Rehearsals start tomorrow with @MagikMagik for a show at the Fox Theater on Jan 31. http://t.co/4CzFaB6sYy

22hr journey + 9hr jetlag + a rotten cold =  #crash
@lpsrsmith thanks ;-) the piece I wrote for @davos #wef2014 is called "Leap" and both studio and live versions will be on my upcoming album!

The journey home from @davos is 17hrs so far. 2 more to go.
Landed at SFO and waiting for the hourly bus north. my least favorite part of a journey...the sonoma county airport "express"
Thank you @davos @weforum. Thank you @flight404 for the incredible video that went with #LEAP. Thank you everyone I met. #grateful #wef14
On my way back to SFO from @davos. What an amazing week. I need to collect my thoughts and tell you about it. #wef14

@lucaskrech ;-)
I get the sense that the question of how to balance career and family is, to @Davos Man, a woman's problem. #wef2014
@SomaFmRusty I've met two burners so far. There must be more, but they might be keeping it secret.
I've talked to many women at @davos this week. What do we often end up talking about? How to balance family &amp; work. #wef2014

It's been a few days and I need to do some cello practicing this morning. I'll be back at @davos #WEF2014 this afternoon.

I think all the (now missing) power adaptors I've bought for every continent are hanging out with my lost socks in the 5th dimension.
@PapaSFans I'll be there. I'll keep you posted. #wef2014
And now is the time before a trip when I search for the euro power adaptors and don't find them. #wef2014
@dansinker you don't have to worry about them menacing you there. watch out for that lake

@wishinghand I was just considering some yesterday actually. I think I'm sold
All day I've thought it was Thursday. So pleased to discover it's Wednesday! Like discovering a $20 bill in my pocket.
Aaargh. Tuning. Dammit.
Thank you again Scotland for your fine spirit. (cough)
@ODCsf After my performance at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week!
@autojim this repair will get the cello through Davos next week so the crack doesn't get worse. Full repair is risky and takes a week or so
@autojim It was a 24 process and just a quick tapping and gluing thing. Eventually the top will have to come off to fix it properly
@ODCsf you're right about that. Time, where does it go?
He's not on Twitter, but I'd like to thank Andrew Carruthers for repairing my cello on such short notice. Had a scary 2in crack on the side.
@hickmanish alas no
#FirstWorldProblems
I have nothing to wear to a gala and only dress in my closet is my wedding dress. Any female Davos attendees have any tips?

@csdaley me too. I think it would be a bit faster if trains were involved. The journey from SFO to home is at 2hrs so far and not there yet.
Car, 2 planes, a bus and now a taxi. Takes as long to get home from Indiana as it does from Europe.
@AndreiPopa nope. But I enjoyed their sign in the airport terminal!
@RealPJP thank you!
SFO! Bit by bit, I'm getting closer to home. Now for the bus that will get me nearish to my forest.

@ItsJimOMeara thank you very very much
Thanks very much @MPR. Happy to be here http://t.co/X9nNwCAErW
@joelcorelitz yes. I just deleted all my prefs and that seemed to help
@autojim ah. Forehead slap. Shows you what I know about cars! #nothing
@neilhimself that bit about lightening strikes and gods displeasure? I really, really love that and keep reading it just to laugh. Ta much.
@autojim I love driving the VW tdi though. It's the computer stuff I'm worried about
@autojim lol!
@autojim it shattered my faith in new cars. It's the comprise shit that fails. I want a 100% mechanical car!
@autojim it did seem weird! Regular old key ignition but the panel stopped recognizing our keys. Had to wait a week for a new part
@WorldofDub yes
@autojim we were stranded in the forest for 4 hrs until a tow truck could get us. Luckily the weather was nice!
@autojim 1/3 of the way to Oregon for Xmas the VW died. Instrument cluster failed. Had to tow it 200 miles east to the nearest dealer.
My brands are failing me. My new under warranty VW had a major breakdown over Christmas and I'm not happy with my new MacBook Pro.
Let me rephrase that. I've only had to force quit applications 1000 times the last 3 days on Mavericks on a new MacBook Pro. No biggie ;-(
I've only had to force quit applications maybe 1000 times since using OS mavericks...no biggie. Um.
@indeciSEAN or really I mean...silent scream
@indeciSEAN eek
I feel like the bizarre behavior I'm experiencing in mavericks is kind of, gulp, window-y. #afraid
@battlebot wow. Awesome! Come say hello backstage
Wow, just got a new MacBook Pro and boy am I hating Mavericks. First time that has ever happened Apple. I am worried about you.
@jc_sum why thank you, it worked!
Hello Minneapolis! Doesn't seem too cold. But I found a down jacket at the second-hand store that helps a lot.
My cello and I are on our way to Minneapolis.
@NLebrecht thanks again and no worries! I'm on my way to a concert in Minneapolis, wish my cello luck staying warm.
Humidifying the cello in preparation for the flight to the arctic, aka Minneapolis.
It is a day for tomato soup
@NLebrecht thank goodness I don't have stage fright anymore. Although I'd probably still fall apart at an unfriendly audition like that.
@NLebrecht i studied it in school too. It's that I quit my job to focus on it for 6mo. But stage fright did me in anyway.
Bloomington concertgoers! I will send out your meet &amp; greet details tonight. Look for email from tickets@zoekeating.com. See u soon
@NLebrecht just thought I'd point that out ;-) but thanks again.
@NLebrecht I studied the Shostakovich in college with Rolf Gjelsten and Franco Rossi...so it wasn't totally out of nowhere
@NLebrecht happy to be written about, so thank you for that. Your piece does imply I picked up the cello 6 months before the audition ;-)
@BilboBethins thanks for listening. Celloly, Z
@Cello_guy yeah, his is the definitive recoding for me. #cellogod
@Cello_guy thank you ! It's been years but I still love the Shostakovich cello sonata. In college I felt like it was my piece.
@Cello_guy @NLebrecht It's ok, doesn't bother me at all. I love what I do and I already found my audience. http://t.co/cwh9HCuqF5
@Cello_guy yup
@burnumd I haven't sent them yet, but will soon!
I did spend 3yrs of my childhood in Medicine Hat, Alberta so you'd think cold wouldn't give me such heebie jeebies.
@bstemmler done!
@drpants I'll be sure to wear pants.
Canadians are probably ashamed of me.
@bstemmler space blankets and hand warmers, good idea! I'm playing at the Cedar Cultural Center on Wed. Guest list spot if you want it ;-)
Yes, I am vaguely worried about the weather this week for my Midwest tour. #wimp
How are those spectators in the colosseum not freezing to death?
@JLChappell hey you! I can go back to my old laptop. Was hoping to use it to play at Davos on Jan 25
@LPdevotee or, in the mouth of the wolf, as they say in Italy (ie good luck)
.@LPdevotee I know, my last album is as old as my son. They were, um, released around the same time ;-) New album this year...
@strangerthings I love coming up with wacky alternate swear words. They invariably make me laugh, which then diffuses whatever started it!
@strangerthings I made a conscious effort to stop swearing some time ago (doesn't always work) and "fiddlesticks" is one I use often ;-)
@strangerthings fiddlesticks
"Polar Vortex". Is that a band?
@petergregson ick!! I feel for you
When programming all the events that occur in a live piece, I can only work in 30 minute chunks until my brain hurts and needs a rest.
A new song is finished and I'm doing the tedious midi programming so I can play it live. This part takes forever and always feels insane
@mskaff I agree. #STEAM is the way to go
@Cello_guy about classical you mean? I stopped wanting to be a part of it. I've moved on.
@mskaff no, not dead. Just changing I think
@autojim oops, didn't realize. I thought the digital version was free
@catsintheattic I don't use the center griddle. I've burned myself on it so many times and it is too heavy to lift out and clean!
New Year pancakes http://t.co/SJrr2fHzih
@TR_Johnson42 do it!! ;-)
@autojim that sounds great . Happy new year to you too!
Ok, not totally doing nothing. There is a box of chocolate covered marzipan and a rediscovered bottle of bubbly.
@Jennifer_deG the glamour! Wouldn't have it any other way
@brian_barton you as well! You're almost there
@davidhussman if she's in Portland, I think I'll be there in the spring...fingers crossed. Happy new year!
The Little One is almost in bed. I'm totally happy to stay in, doing absolutely nothing, on New Year's Eve.
Dear People of Earth....Happy New Year

@briancrain do keep posting how it's going! We need to hear real numbers from a broad range of artists
@briancrain the point I always try to make is that there is no single way to do it. Every artist is unique.
@briancrain but this is nothing new for me. I decided to limit streaming in 2005. I'm still following the same plan!
@briancrain absolutely, true. People are creatures of habit
@briancrain actually, redid the math: it's roughly 50% itunes, 25% bandcamp, 15% amazon, 10% live and 0.5% Spotify
@briancrain if someone finds me on Spotify they'll soon discover most of my music is elsewhere. If they don't follow through, that's ok
@briancrain that's cool. I still see no reason to for myself
@briancrain it's my funeral of course ;-)
@briancrain also I have and want no digital distributor. Until they let me work with them directly like other services do, no beans
@briancrain the gap between 1% and 50% is large. My sales are pretty even btw the albums
@briancrain I guess it's different for each artist. My itunes is still 50% and Spotify less than  1%
@DonnyDonM where do you live? I played in London this year and will probably do so again next year
@scottsigler I love well-crafted depictions of alternate futures, pasts, realities, utopias and distopias. Look forward to reading yours!
@scottsigler my escapes are historical fiction and fantasy fiction. love it when they collide, like in Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell
@briancrain that is very interesting!
@scottsigler I say 'hear' since I tend to 'read' books by listening to them in the car on tour. But I read it if that's the format avail ;-)
@scottsigler I'm looking forward to hearing this novel you're working on!
@Bigwobbles ;-)
Thank you @jumpphilly for this review of my show in Philadelphia last week &gt; http://t.co/HGsnH0KrTs
@scottsigler I really love that: "an air of desperation and impending doom". Thanks ;-)
@stuartdredge oops ! Should work now
@stuartdredge I can send you that when I get home from tour this week
After a massive breakfast of eggs and grits with Paul Mercer it's hard to imagine I will ever be hungry again.
@stuartdredge you mean downloads or apple imatch? I have statements for those too.
Magnificent TSA agents at Atlanta airport who let me help them pack the cello back up. Thanks very much! Today is looking up
thanks @DeltaAssist. Today is a brand new day
What are my chances today @DeltaAssist of avoiding the $200 fee to check my cello? Pretty please with chocolate sprinkles?
Today I have to fly @delta again. Wish me luck
I got to Atlanta by the skin of my teeth. The concert went well. But it is midnight and I just realized I haven't eaten today. #crash
What a day. #crash
. @DeltaAssist it's ok. You got me here at last. You probably need a drink too
here!!!
@jonathancoulton thank you ;-)
Navigating for the cab driver who seems never to have been to Atlanta before
Breathe. I'll get there when I get there. At least I'm on the ground
Now I really need a drink
Omg no crew at the gate to get us off the plane. Another 15 minutes they say!!! ARGGH @delta
I need a drink.
Don't start without me!
Touchdown!! Now have to deplane, get the cello and get a taxi to the venue. See you soon
Showtime in 3.5 hrs. @delta #fail
Spoke too soon. We've returned to the gate because @delta ground crew failed to remove a bag from the plane. Will I get to my show?
On the plane. See you at the show. I play at 8pm at Terminal West in Atlanta
We're boarding!!! I land in Atlanta at 6:30 and will get a taxi to Terminal West. Meet and greet will have to happen after the show!
I think I'm having a panic attack.
Argh

Please, Oh Great Travel Gods, get me to Atlanta today. Thank you.
This @delta plane is not leaving Toronto. I'm trying to get on an Air Canada flight that lands in Atlanta at 7pm. More soon.
Pilot says they can't get heat to the wing flaps, or something.
There is a mechanical issue with my @delta flight to Atlanta. Looking at other options out of Toronto to get to my show. Anyone have a jet?
Maintenance issue with my plane out of Toronto. Delayed. Hope I get to Atlanta in time to have a soundcheck.
Looking forward to getting back to #cellobaby and #cellobabydaddy tomorrow. I miss them
@adamwc Toronto! Same, I think
So much snow on the runway. Not worried. Um. Gulp.
@madridthekid eek! Do they?
Remember this story from March about Lynn Harrell's cello and Delta? "Only you can prevent cello mileage fraud" http://t.co/t7CenNhDsI
@ArisTake I've got a flight case for it and check it
Is the weather nice in Atlanta? Can I put my ear flap hat away?
@allenwentz I don't really. It's an illusion
Meanwhile, what a friendly security staff here at Toronto Pearson today. Thanks for making that part more pleasant!
If I can convince another 10 of you to come to my concert tonight it will make up for the $200 @Delta took to fly my cello to Atlanta ;-)
Also, cellists...the fees of the major airlines who do charge for a cello (united, usairways, American) are half of Delta's
The cello case is wider than golf clubs, so yes it is oversize. But it weighs only 30lbs. I think a $200 charge is too much
fellow cellists, fly Virgin, JetBlue, Southwest, Alaska or Frontier if you don't want to be fleeced. No one charges as much as delta though
I think it is free to check golf clubs on most airlines. Cellists aren't coveted business travelers and are actively discouraged by @delta
I never fly @delta but today I had no choice. They just charged me $200 to check my cello. I said it was golf clubs but they didn't buy it.
Sorry to leave you Toronto. Have to go now and fly to my concert in Atlanta tonight.
Concert is over. I'm in Canada. Therefore, poutine. @ Poutini's House of Poutine http://t.co/UwGFJlvWW0

Well, in 60 years of marriage we've never used the word 'divorce'. 'Murder' yes, but never 'divorce'. (my godfather last night at dinner)

That's some serious snow..to me at least. Hope it's not too serious for my audience tonight. Travel safe folks. #toronto

Dear Toronto: for days the Drake Hotel website has said my show on the 14th is sold out.... but it is not. Probably best to call them!
Day off! I'm staying in bed.
@jesnider I think that's not until next week! I'll be in Toronto by the
Now that's a lineup @ Kent Stage http://t.co/pouLVRO1oG
Made it to Kent, OH !

 Today: Kent, OH - Dec 8 at The Kent Stage http://t.co/lPpv4FiwxL
@amezri yeah! I've gotten some of that. I think slow is wise!
I might have been born in Canada but I've lived my adult life in California and I am a snowstorm driving newbie. Phew. Taking a break.
The hardest thing about this tour so far is the Christmas music in the lobby of every hotel. MAKE IT STOP!!!!
@lentower it's the snow I'm worried about ! #californian
Yikes, my body is telling me I played the cello a little too hard last night.
Wish me luck on my drive from Cincinnati to Cleveland today

@DetroitSymphony you're welcome, thanks for having me. great job creating such a welcoming vibe. Maybe I'll pop in for yoga in January
The MusicBox at the @detroitsymphony was the perfect venue. Sad to leave Detroit. I'd like to stick around to take pics of old buildings.
@AeryKeeps be careful out there.
@caseytmalone thank you for coming!

I'm not worried about it
@egojab i'm not worried about it ;-)
@egojab lol, probably. but don't do that. you should listen to as much music as possible. it's good for your health!
@CoffeeNutSydney that would be a great idea. They should sell one! Meanwhile you could rip the download?
@musicbrainz hope it works!

@SomaFmRusty where is that time machine when you need it
The streaming music payout stuff is not what we should get our knickers in a knot about. Get mad at this &gt; http://t.co/R51ykChsaB
@kotope I have no idea!
@autojim I don't mind at all ;-)
@SomaFmRusty just pointing it out, my work here is done though! happy about the linking up with merch, concerts, etc.
and that's all I'll say on the subject. Just clearing that up ;-)
The more music Spotify subscribers listen to, the smaller the per-stream payouts to the rightsholders @arstechnica: http://t.co/xJVOSgeYEV
@milch_mit_honig yes! going to for my next release and remixes of previous material
So for artists to earn more on the service, Spotify needs to have more subscribers who DON'T listen to a lot of music. #weird
The more music Spotify subscribers listen to, the smaller the per-stream payouts to the rightsholders. http://t.co/tmNdMQ6Tla
@arstechnica because the more music Spotify subscribers listen to, the smaller the payouts to the rightsholders.
@arstechnica It's true, Spotify payments are an average of that moment in time...but we still get the reports per stream and at what price
@stuartdredge "too" i mean
@stuartdredge possibly. maybe they will answer that question to?
.@stuartdredge right, the more music Spotify subscribers listen to, the less each artists payment is
@stuartdredge the spotify reports I get are quite granular. I can see every single stream &amp; its payment. So that statement is confusing.
@stuartdredge they are better than youtube ;-) the next elephant in the room
@stuartdredge the @arstechnica article says Spotify doesn't pay "per stream" but it's still how revenue is formatted http://t.co/ANthYf472E
@stuartdredge i updated my royalty spreadsheet, although I guess now it's unnecessary ;-) http://t.co/EmJqlEjwCk
@stuartdredge thanks for reporting on it all
@TNBBC thank you ;-) I find shopping pretty darn stressful too.
@stuartdredge Just saw it this morning! It's good news!
@subvocal_band I wasn't planning on having one! No offense or anything, I just prefer to do a super long set
But then, capitalism is the ultimate pyramid scheme ;-)
Every explanation of the subscription streaming profit model still sounds like a pyramid scheme to me.
transparency = good

@solobasssteve there!
@solobasssteve Artists have been critcized for being vocal, but I doubt @Spotify would throw us this bone if we hadn't made some noise
@solobasssteve i meant...

"Oracle declined repeated requests from NPR to comment."
I was wrong about the $40 million. That was the money paid to Oracle just for Oregon's healthcare exchange, which also doesn't work.

@RayEmureMusic I did. Will reply while I'm on tour this week
@lucaskrech but if i'm going to move the family to vermont, we might as well just go back to canada!
@lucaskrech yup. my sister lives there for that reason
@jessevondoom except for the cold. brr
@jessevondoom that's why my sister moved there!
our grandfathered plan is sucky so we just don't go to the doctor and instead practice superstitious rituals to stay healthy.
Still holding out for public/single payer heath insurance in my lifetime. Although I might have to move back to Canada for that...
@mrbitterness not eligible
my health coverage choices on the exchange: triple the family premium (as much as the mortgage!) or keep grandfathered plan w/ no maternity
@WarpandWoofAdam that would be cool though
@WarpandWoofAdam weirdo ;-)
thanks @thelocals. good luck on your tour too
#tourplanningtip @Docjazz4 figure out your daily budget first, and plan out your logistics all at once based on that daily budget.
oh shoot. I almost forgot to order windows for my new studio. probably going to need those.
A tour logistics planning kind of day. Not my favorite.

@solobasssteve lol!!! you're highly respected in your music and opinions mr lawson ;-)
@MisterManny you're totally right.
@echoesandwaves indeed!
I guess if you're going to be in the public eye you have to actively control your story, or others will control it for you.
But clearly my stance it too nuanced. Everyone wants to frame it as artists vs tech, and tries to put me in their little bucket.
I speak out to keep a level playing field level for unaffiliated artists, not just for labels &amp; corporations who can make backroom deals.
I'm so tired of my comments being taken out of context and misrepresented. I will stop commenting on music industry issues.
.@camilitocamilon FYI I don't think tech is killing the music industry. Quite the opposite. It's enabling it.

@GoneCaving it's funny, I hear that recording and I can't stand it. I think "I'm so much better now!!"
@wojsvenwoj YES
@vampandora lots o mussels to make up for it!
@vampandora I know, its a bummer. You might find some porcini though. They're out there.
@vampandora instead of going out to lunch. we'll MAKE lunch
@vampandora I only just had that idea. But maybe it has legs? For the west coast at least
@jessevondoom I only eat cute animals I might have known personally. This little guy is from down the road.
@chrisblue14 maybe Optimist  (http://t.co/sAJAGNXJrO) and Escape Artist?  (http://t.co/FgsbJ4NMBu). and thank you ;-)
Thank you for all these recipe ideas folks. Much appreciated!
@MikeKSmith ah, that's good to know too. I'll make everyone eat their vegetables.
@eirkeirkeirk oh rofl, rofl!!
When I have the time, I do really like to cook. Maybe for my album release tour I should cook dinners for listeners before each concert. Hm.
@eirkeirkeirk uh oh. the vegetarians in the family are going to be appalled.
@notmoro nice. thanks
@lonesomebilydad no one likes tough duck! true. no pressure or anything ;-)
I do apologize, vegetarians.
@MisterManny me too!
@solobasssteve um. he's a bit on the dead side i'm afraid
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. Family is coming. I have a duck. I have never cooked a duck. Help.

@jessevondoom "chicken butt". let the hilarity ensue!
To properly tell a joke like a 3 year old, just repeat it 20 times in a row.
I guess 3 and 1/2 is the joke-telling threshold? #cellokid: "Knock knock" "Who's there?" "Chicken!" "Chicken who?" "I already told you!!!"
@alancfrancis it certainly is annoying!

@mmasnick (oops, backwards sentence. brain)
@mmasnick i hope so too. i don't usually let people film me because tend to they tell THEIR story, not mine.
@mmasnick my guess is that he made the pitch so skewed to get funding. but i don't think that was wise.
@mmasnick but i want to believe in him, because he does all my post-production. it's awkward
@mmasnick yup. i'm uncomfortable with it. he knows
@mmasnick my understanding of it was that he is going to tell a balanced story...but the trailer and his statement don't reflect that.
@mmasnick that's my problem with Count's film right now, the trailer takes me out of context. i'm hoping his film is more balanced
@AndreiPopa I like those. Don't know any company who rents them though !
@BostonDavid lol! It's true, cellos go best into hatchbacks. I usually end up with an SUV since sedans are tricky
@KeatingNation thanks Keating ;-)
@mattstevensloop people in the biz still say that to me. "if only you would sing"
I hate that 99.9% of US car rental companies don't have hatchbacks and even if they do, you can't reserve one.
If you purchased tickets for Detroit direct from me &amp; didn't get an email with deets of our meet n greet, write to tickets@zoekeating.com!
@RayEmureMusic sure, write me at info@zoekeating.com if you like
@MisterManny yup, that's the idea. I haven't been at work since that video though ;-) no electricity and traveling
@bergopolis @scottsigler I can't tell you how thrilled this makes me. Should have more music for you to write to soon ;-)
@SomaFmRusty yup. Trying to convince the spouse! It just went out again too
Dammit. Power is out again.
I know, I should try to do something about my electricity addiction....but I am so glad the power just came back.
@hrab0001 ha ha!
@wjohnstweet that's heavy
Power is out. That means winter must be here in the forest.
Don't worry, I won't segue into a lament about how Burning Man used to be so much better....
@indeciSEAN at least on twitter we can't see the cute baiting images!
@indeciSEAN I just notice that my home feed is almost entirely links to some 20 best photos of: kittens, young celebs, etc. or to upworthy

@LPdevotee hm. don't know if i saw it. FB is a bit nutty for me. can you email it to info@zoekeating.com? thank you!
@theoal nope, I have no connection to GEMA at all

@jesnider is that what it is??? oh dear.
Actually, it might not be playing the concerts that makes me ache. It's probably it is the lousy hotel beds and the air travel.
5th concert in a row tonight. I am one aching pile of bones. Remind me not to do this again.
@james_makes aw shucks, thank you. My first keynote, so I was nervous!
And here I am at SFO again. I am weary.
Oh, and Elvis Costello walked into the cafe I was in. That always happens in NYC too right?

@solobasssteve gotta start somewhere!

@solobasssteve "spluge" was our word for a horrible diaper bomb.
@mmasnick @solobasssteve The @Lefsetz pop culture report is very interesting. Meanwhile things are still fine over here in outsider-land.
@solobasssteve artistically poor + financially rich = pop?
@solobasssteve true. none of my live sales are reported because Nielsen won't allow me to.
read it here&gt; The @Lefsetz Letter: http://t.co/7vKChQgrxE
more @Lefsetz: In 2011, 102 tracks accounted for 15% of total sales.  So 0.00001% of the 8 mill tracks sold represented ~ 1/6 of all sales
Wow. @Lefsetz reports that of the 8 mil unique digital tracks sold in 2011, 94% sold fewer than 100 units and 32% percent sold only one copy

Things I wish I'd asked Klaus Schwab: I'm curious what you see as the role of the arts in the world sphere. #wefcal
Sometimes I don't know why I'm here. But artists are outsiders, and maybe outside views are needed. #wefcal
I like what you said @DrueKataoka, about adding the arts to STEM and making it STEAM. #wefcal
I drove from my forest to SF for a World Economic Forum meeting. Lots to think about. Taking it all in. #wefcal

@IronCurtaiNYC i think i'll keep calling it an umlaut. i don't want to have something that can be confused with diarrhea over my name!
@IronCurtaiNYC well blame my UK grade school teachers, who said it was an umlaut ;-) makes me ZoEEE instead of Zo.
@lucaskrech ha! i did send them off to the accountant. waiting on their sentence.
@true_bool wow, that's got to be complicated sometimes!
Lack of character encoding bites me again.
