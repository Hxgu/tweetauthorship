How about Johnson's second half adjustments. Shut down q's 3 and 4! @VeeDub78
it is March and I think it is too early to write the @Eagles off. But maybe everyone here knows more and the season is already over.
Short-term returns? Hardly. Where it is to say that they can't take profits. Talk to them. I have. They know they can do it @GeorgeBoyan3
All I am saying is that the team Chip had was not going to win a Super Bowl and some players  didn't fit.
Why don't the Chinese take profits in all of that eurodebt they bought during the big fall??..
The lack of faith in anything Chip does now overlooks that we were a 10-6 team and had tons of injuries and a horrendous quarterback.
I will take that as a joke as I watched pretty much every Seahawk game in the last two years. t@kcchiefsjunky

It's stunning. The $PCYC deal. Also the press coverage that said it was a done deal that we relied on-FT? Any answers from them? Where $JNJ?
$SCTY is a stock and as a stock I said I didn't like it and haven't liked it and it has gone down. That's be correct @GuillotineG
Second stunning trade this week, Shady and now $PCYC. My trust owns $ABBV-and I know Imbruvica is big, but wow, that's a lot of money/stock.
Very good piece in @Grantland33 about "the trade" that made me feel much better about losing @CutonDime25. It's just emotional that's all.

$JCP is okay. I have talked about many retailers on the show that are better. @MadMoneyOnCNBC  @Whatslefttoput
We will draft WRs and QBs at top of #FF this year. RBs down low. Maybe Chip is mirroring what we know?
Which major drug chain uses Chinese vitamin/vitamin supplements? Any ideas? I don't want to be long them..
No, can't get my arms or head around the trade. Third most yards. A fabulous worker. Pop's fave. Proudly wore #25. Have to deal with this
Last word before  I cry about this-I trust Chip to do it right, but when you bleed eagle green you bleed for guys like Shady @CutonDime25
This is a @AdamSchefter story so it is happening.. I may have to violate my no drink during the week rules!! @DirtyDaver

And no, i am not saying that Demarco is better than @CutonDime25 -DM had fabu OLine. But Dallas is unbeatable with him I fear
But John, with Sanchez as QB Walter Payton would have had a bad year @Fantasy_Guru
Okay ,how about this, Eagles make play for Demarco Murray--two birds with one stone!
The Eagles should move to New Jersey b/c I will have to buy all New Jerseys

Have a stock question? Tweet it to me using #CramerQ and I'll answer them at 10am today at the @NYSE on @TheStreetTV!
@GuyJohnsonTV last week four of my fave companies had VERY strong European numbers this q. All had been hurting in Europe. Big sea change.
I like the change at the top at $HOT because I think the company can prosper under Vail Resort ex ceo &amp; Philly friend Adam Aron.
It is biz as usual--dance continues between Germany and Greece. Nothing changes. In the end it will be fine for $BMY, $ACT, $ABC,  $CVS, etc
He's great. Car's great. Stock, not so great. $TSLA. @randy_peets

Those were all Paul Volcker's doing. Fed chief with horse sense. @ltecato
I liked $TSLA even as it was a cult stock until this last q. Has that crossed your mind? Or are you vacationing intellectually? @DaSToRM112
Wow, I didn't know so many were in $TSLA for the takeover. I think it is eps, or lack thereof, are more important@jimmyvegas337

If the fundamentals were any good $RIG would be a buy. But in the end you are stuck with them. I like the new chairman, Miller  @adjmcc
Blocking the dozens of people who have said that $AAPL or $F or $GM should/will  buy $TSLA. That's not how my feed works. Sorry
$AMZN is a cult but it has some real opportunities and i liked the last quarter very much. Same with $NFLX  @OTG_Capital
Yep, we should have some opportunities with the breakdown of the Greek talks and the heat up of Ukraine. Think domestic. Working on it now
This was my big fear with $RIG-that it couldn't pay that dividend. It can't. Remember oils aren't out of the woods yet.
$CLX has very little emerging markets, that was a subtext of the segment. $UN has a lot of emerging markets @DannyTiseo
$RIG CEO steps down. Now there's a guy that's had a tough run...
I have said all along $TSLA stockholders are cultists. They don't care about eps, revs, balance sheets. So i will now block all cultists
Bottom line on $TSLA_-if i thought it would go much higher, as i did for a very long time, i would say nothing. I am worried about it now
If you want to focus on the short-term fine. $TSLA can go higher. I am talking about eps, sales, finances, prospects @eq_johnson @WSJ
$AAPL news came out after the close. Go buy some $TSLA, don't bother me none. @nysparty @gene70 @Hogie100
Oh hush up. I am not against $TSLA. I want $TSLA to do  better. But you are too obtuse to know that. @brademyste
$COST knew it had $AXP over a barrel and $AXP gambled and lost and has been incommunicative since.
I think $AXP had hidden from us the importance of this deal and i think that a huge part of its growth was $COST. @LawlessGregg

So Elon Musk is the next Jobs? Yeah, yeah, sure sure..http://t.co/n3wOkXOWyd
Painful to admit but $AXP has NO credibility now. Truly a bad move by the ceo and team which may not be unscathed.
Cant go wrong with either stock http://t.co/608O0ro0vv
It's not that I am short, they're tall! http://t.co/EmBhsjiPmW

We will be interviewing @KDTrey5 and @JHarden13 @SquawkStreet today. @KDTrey5 MVP speech in top ten great oratories for me.
Cease fire; Greek 70 year bond stretch out, oil stable at a new lower level-welcome back to thinking about U.S. profits!
Or maybe, @FerroTV, the bottom was put in when @GuyJohnsonTV went back to looking dapper.
John Chambers, ceo of $CSCO, world's largest networker, has had many months now of good northern Europe &amp; now Southern Europe's better
@FerroTV , @GuyJohnsonTV @flacqua I am getting a pretty positive read from many ceos about positive #s away from Germany in Europe
@FerroTV YES! Totally nailed what is really going on. Thank you for telling the comeback story. It is empirical!! I am no longer alone here!
I am loving the endless defenses of Elon Musk. Look, he has it to be able to invent greatness but accountability matters. Sorry

@UnderArmour just crushing it. Kevin's the real deal
No chatter at all about the turn in Japan or the trillions in stimulus in China. Just negatives about a small country named Greece.

This is a rally based on "what happens if things go right." will be a them for me today/tonight.
Yes, more sellers than buyers.. for now..@JDR1024
NO, the whole point of this rally is that Greece is winning. Germany is blinking. You need to focus on the new reality @ShawnPreisler

Oh for heaven's sake. just agree with me. I have thought it through more than you. Enuf of this nonsense  @trigtrader
Do you believe in a V recovery or a U recovery or NO recovery?@NeilAtkinson58
Oil: slashes right through $50 and the SPX futures jump 5 points. Same trade; same time; same results. The V return thesis is in play
If you think that oil is in a V bottom you need to own $CLB. if you think it is a U, try out $RDS/a, Royal Dutch, like my charitable trust

OK, $SHAK's going to be too hot to buy in the aftermarket.  If they priced it at $21 that means it probably opens as high as $40.

Don't you love a stock that goes down when a co-founder ENDORSES its ceo? The same thing happened at $MCD before the firing. $TWTR
I have been pushing $OPK endlessly and now you want in? Oh jeez. not air.. @__Bolt
The short base in $BA (meaning how many people were betting against it) must have been monstrous. They just didn't listen...
Jack Dorsey defends Costolo like Jim Skinner defended Thompson to us on @SquawkStreet ??? ($TWTR v. $MCD) Stranger things have happened
Dont buy $TGT, $COST or $WMT until you read which benefits the most from the strong dollar http://t.co/MLQRvBxz4B
Yes, congratz to my friend @hblodget and @BusinessInsider for the new Axel Springer stake!! Totally deserving .
If you are buying $RIG, $SDRL, $ESV off of Obama's plan to drill off east coast; forget it. The majors won't even bid Very little oil..

Homegamers can help to get stock. I am not going to NOT talk about $SHAK b/c some can't get in on the deal! @ObliviousDorkus
I will do a piece about ipo's . lots don't know how it works. You call your broker--try to get some-may not get it, tight deal @TLKKnopp
When I profile a $SHAK i do so b/c i want people to learn about it and try to get it, but i don't control the latter.
I have always felt you need accounts with both full service and discounters-full serve guys have $SHAK if you do lots of business@MikeAmmo
Big surprises on $AAPL call: China, I-Pay, I-watch tease
$SHAK raises price--looking $17-19 which typically means $24-28 opening. so you really need to be in on the deal...Hard to get
$SHAK isn't comparing year over year. But maybe some don't put in for stock b/c of it?  @fantasyhowto
Let's see how many people opine on $AAPL today without having actually listened to the call..like $UTX yesterday
Sometimes when you are working until all hours--i got another 3 ahead of me and u read &amp;*^(&amp;^ like that, you just gotta level 'em.@JWGreen_
Best takeaway from $AAPL Call? I think that Apple is going to roll retailers like it did record companies..
If you hate Marissa Mayer you hate ceos of stocks that have amazing performance. Did she fire all of you haters? Is that the deal? $YHOO
The tax consequences were tricky. And what the heck is the beef with getting more than a triple. What's wrong with people here! @mpk62
Fortunately the trust owns $AAPL. But unfortunately it owns some $MSFT; the good with the bad. As i always say don't trade $AAPL, own it.

Honestly, i don't want any drilling off the east coast. Keystone is a lot safer. But there's not enough oil there to drill anyway.

We got the best performing stock out there tonight: $PII--snow mobiles; orvs, motorcycles..upside

They have won a Super Bowl in the last 3 years. What has $UPS won? $MCD? No medals for trying.@toddyst
Who will hold these ceos accountable? Why is the NFL so much more rigorous than these boards of directors? How can they be so pathetic?
How can the owners of the Bears and the Broncos exercise such discipline and the boards of $MCD and $UPS tolerate such sloppiness. Insane.
Done with sugar-coating underperformance whether it be with ABC at $TWTR, $UPS or $MCD. This is the darned biz NFL for heaven's sake...
Embarrassed by $UPS and $MCD-if this were the NFL the coaching changes would be made this afternoon. Intolerable performance. Intolerable

Lets get to work!! Lower rates, lower gasoline, heating nat gas--BAD?
Ask yourself, would you be buying stocks if oil went up ten percent today?
Prepping for @TODAYshow and why we need to put lower oil prices in the right, not wrong, light
I will be on @TODAYshow near the top of the show to talk about today's beatdown...
People will get hurt by lower oil prices but there are fewer people in the industry than there are those who consume the product!
The GOOD $ISIS
Prepping for $CSCO and $ISIS!
Confused about why people don't like $ISIS--this thing is a real juggernaut. and now starting to commercialize the pipe!
If $GM gets back to $33 that's a gift.. $FB down despite very positive note.. $HD below $98. $MCD below $90.. Some compelling buys.
@Stephanie_Link &amp; @ScottWapnerCNBC going at it--worth putting on right now!
So excited that we have $CSCO on from CES and $ISIS on to talk about the amazing deal with Janssen from $JNJ!! Just incredible start to 2015
Have a stock question? Tweet it to me using #CramerQ and I'll answer them at 10am today at the @NYSE on @TheStreetTV!
R U ready Ski Daddy! Brand news shows today...Come get 'em!
@StuartScott was an inspiration to many: passionate, brilliant, great dad, fabulous sportscaster, fighter. The loving originator of Booyah.
Happy New Year to all!!! Here's to a fabulous and healthy 2015!!!!!
I love my garden so much! Had some of my tomato sauce last night.. just killer...@mswapan
I think it is more of a coffee theme park so people wait.. $SBUX is so well managed.. @MikeChelan
I would stick with $ISIS--very important that people not lose faith so quickly with these kinds of stocks. Provided they have original drugs
Papers focused on the 16 states hurt by lower oil prices; how about the other 34?
Merry Christmas to all! I hope it is a great one for all!!
@Eagles certainly disappointing. But real fans stick with the club and cheer them on. @davespadaro
Everyone in this business knows you can't game fraud. It is a fact of life. That's part of the finance business.
I think it is pretty clear that I agreed with Dan that if it could hold the 50 day you should do some buying. Hear that??  @LauraMcD3
@megtirrell What are you hearing out there--checking in on $SGEN?
50 day moving average holding for the biotechs as we talked about last night @MadMoneyOnCNBC
Lets say 143% of the Dow's increase is caused by the Fed. I was at the bank yesterday-no teller stopped a deposit from stock profits!!!
Same for 8000 points. I guess you sat them out on principle. Smart move!! I am shamed into making money @wbumper @TODAYshow
You want a gift card play buy $HAWK--very strong company...
oh, and lest we forget, I can be negative on @TODAYshow if I have to be....
Faux worries: Venezuela, Texas real worries; Europe, Petrobras, Pemex, Moscow
Let's say China goes to 6% which is possible; can't we go to 6%, which is possible; we've been there @DeborahHerman @TODAYshow
Can't wait for @TODAYshow where there is good news...which doesn't have to be caveated..
I think we have had a bit of a Santa rally so far, no? @PilotJoe78 @carlquintanilla @BeckyQuick
I am on @TODAYshow this morning talking about this incredible market and 5% GDP growth and what it means for people ..
Lots of questions about biotech which means people weren't watching the show. I pour everything into that darned show including the answers
I think you should listen to the show more closely  @Sstmec @joshuaemberlin @adamfeuerstein
Yo, Bozo, oops, Mr. Bozo, we disagree constantly. Show some respect and knowledge ... @joshuaemberlin @adamfeuerstein
No one is saying that. I am describing what managers are doing. Why be so cynical though? Why act so entitled? @jjones5533 @musicandwork
Some nasty looking biotech charts... hmmm.....
@boonepickens has helped me immensely on understanding supply and demand... oil
could @boonepickens be more subtle about how he feels! HA!
$FEYE--should i push it hard even if like $PANW more-is this a Bob Marley thesis? Could I Be Loved if I push $FEYE even if it is wrong??
$ECA bought those properties from $FCX for $3.1 billion in June--at the top-tell us more-which counties?? @ABeickerBabe
Make sure your five followers know how scared you are of equities please. They may not pay attention today  @DougKopec
In the spirit of the holidays I am not calling for  @dickc 's head any more.. Peace on Earth.  @JerryBadshaw @MrPhill_ @silentmax
When you see big declines in stocks in this market, they tend to be two-three day affairs. They give you better prices. Wait for them
This is what I hate--i obviously still like $ISIS but let it come it. Why not? You want to stand there?   @asianjew222 @MadMoneyOnCNBC
I have reinstated @kookie3434 despite putting the Cowboys score up. Sentimentality. He's basically a good guy. Tribe fan, too. Likes losers.
Hot Roster starts NBA duels tonight--might want to watch tonight on #MadMoney
$TWTR --can it be lost on the board that even a rumor of a change at the top gives the stock its biggest move?
Remember, every personality on tv has a @ but only $TWTR can't figure how to monetize it.
Remember, in the spirit of the holidays I am no longer knocking the ceo/cso.. there are others who are doing it, $TWTR. Don't need me to
Put on @ScottWapnerCNBC because Peck is on talking about $Twtr...and the ceo

@Eagles a weekend of pain-and worry as Boys looks good and Beckham looks unstoppable. We went backwards...
@davespadaro You did a great job this year. It turned out to be a heartbreaker but you were an honest and faithful leader the whole way. Thx
Happy Birthday to @AdamSchefter the best reporter alive and the best friend anyone could ever ask for!
no amateurs behind the bar at Bar San Miguel https://t.co/6N1hXRPhUx
If I do what you want and oil goes below $50 i will be crucified, so, no, I am sorry..@asVitale
I am very concerned about China and Europe and am not sanguine about their prospects @BarryWoola1a
Holy cow.. you have to be kidding me. Do you think I actually agree with Warren? AInt you ever heard of nuance ?@TexVaquero
Those are some good looking dogs!! @imstu47
Periodically I have to remind people here that the vast majority of commentators told you to sell endlessly because of the fed. Hit them
Do some homework on the fundamentals and you can get in the area otherwise you are a total lightweight I don't have time to trifle with
what kind of guy criticizes me for waiting until we were down 100 points before I said buy em and then it rallies? A mountebank, that's who
There are thousands of bears out there staying negative throughout this rally, I was the opposite. Critics should stay focused. Knaves
The bozos who criticize me for waiting for low prices which we got, really couldn't trade their way out of a paper bag.
I've had enough of this second guessing. The dow dropped about 100 points from the time i said don't buy it, and thats when you pick it off
Hollande breaks ranks with Germany over Russian sanctions? The beginning of the end game?

I think you mean "beneath" me, and it isn't b/c those are HUGE sales. Small sales are reasonable..no issue . @harrisonmarkey @dickc
The Chief Selling Officer would do us all a favor if he would become a more ceremonial head of state exec @CastlehillGil @dickc
I like your attitude, however, the sales have been monster sized!  @CastlehillGil @dickc @marissamayer
$TWTR is actually up. Did @dickc finish selling for the day?
Can't wait to hear today @Stephanie_Link go toe to toe with the gang on @ScottWapnerCNBC 's show
Yeah, he just wants a "Danzig" corridor and worries about ethnic Russians like ethnic Germans, in Sudetenland. Munich-Moscow  @3820ct
Nice to see $RAD get back on track..
$ORCL, $JBL both good. Oil higher..$DRI and $KS doing so well..Lots of ground being made up here..
I only need one $TWTR doubter, the one selling stock so aggressively, the Chief Selling Officer, @dickc  @eddieaero
Only a moron would put all his money on anything. Are you short $RH though? Why?@NuWayCapital
Shorts really pressed their bets; the bears were truly out for blood 2 days ago and have been caught leaning the wrong way...l

Yeah, cause it is a big deal. We make big deals out of big deals. Come on, pal! He's sending $TWTR lower. @gregnb @dmf1990 @dickc
Fed Chief Janet Yellen giving @dickc a chance to sell $TWTR at higher prices!!  Jeez maybe she can clean him up as a seller?
He's a beacon, a beacon of selling at $TWTR! But if he were leaving he would be a buyer b/c it would go higher w/o him @dmf1990 @dickc
How about that joker who asked Yellen about the Niners? I mean, come on, she's a winner not a loser!!!
@dickc isn't the Chief Executive Officer of $TWTR, he's the Chief Selling Officer.!!!!!!!
I look at it this way. When @dickc spends time with his family he may be taking time off from selling stock.......@rcomandari @CNBC
Don't you feel that when you buy $TWTR stock you are buying it from that humongous seller, @dickc ?? He's a national supplier of equity!
OK, with Europe down and oil down, why do we think the S&amp;P 500 futures will hold up?
What were you looking for ? @phippsjm @wit_t
If you have questions for Jeff Immelt of $GE please let me hear them. I will do my best to integrate them into my thinking.
Here we go again with the oil futures down badly and the S&amp;P futures up. stop the con game
Thanks to all the patrons of @BarSanMiguelBK tonight as we donated 15% of our take to the local food bank.
Stop lying about me and I will let you follow me b/c I did check off that box, Bozo @alsabogal @marketmodel
@JohnLegere on CNBC trying to sell you a phone!!! .
It is wrong to give a 140 character synopsis of something that i have done 700 words on @1MilDreams
My work has nothing to do with thestreet's rating system. We are separate.. @mikeobrien5209 @twtr @TheStreet
Now is the run on oil to $52....
Rationality setting in as S&amp;P futures cascade and oil begins its march to $52 and perhaps beyond...
Futures down mid 20s and oil down $5 would be more like what has to happen...
You get S&amp;P futures down big and then you get a semblance of a trade to the long side.
Every single question here has been answered a gazilion times;my advice: GET CABLE
Long before $TWTR there was thinking; it took genuine sentences; even paragraphs. There was TV, too. They were all more thoughtful.
Again, read one of my 37 blog entries or watch one of my 12 shows or 32 videos and just listen; it will help;   2@andreozm
Here's how you get a bottom-oil goes to the mid 40s; S&amp;P futures open way down and then reversal..
Futures sinking--that's more like it--probably want to read my stuff on the blog. It is paid. $TWTR's free. But you get what you pay for
I think you need to watch one of my 17 shows  or blogs or services. @GregRummo
Oil down, futures up--not possible? would seem that can' t last..
I have Three Bears piece coming out on http://t.co/MdxkdU6l3Y this morning. Explains the pain!
I liked the pretense of the S&amp;P 500 futures actually being up for a few seconds while oil was down more than a dollar. Machines were slow!
Here comes the plummet to $52 we have been talking about for oil...
Negative transference!!! But other winners obviously. or we would be down even more..@Kelly_Evans @SPCapitalIQ
the vast majority of the followers are negative now and a bunch are in attack mode. That means big drop and then reversal...
We have to calculate how much retail is up to see if it is zero sum! @Kelly_Evans @SPCapitalIQ

The independent oil companies never thought there would be no market for their product. There isn't right now. That's the problem.

Oil down; we down. Man, there's got to be more to this game...

Have a stock question? Tweet it to me using #CramerQ and I'll answer them at 10am today at the @NYSE on @TheStreetTV!
When you get Russia walking out of G-20 and Japan in downturn that many seem shocked by you are going to have a decline for certain.
Just a brutal game; horrendous....
The more I hear from the rabid $GSAT bulls and their personal attacks on my the more i feel my more cautious view is very right

Arguably I would not be talking about Costolo moving on at Twitter if Twitter didn't exist. @JohnBCase
Those of you "stuck" in $TWTR because of me, you are released to move on and hate me in other venues. Have a good weekend
Robert Peck, my fave $TWTR analyst, saying good things on @ScottWapnerCNBC

I like to read everyone's tweet. I actually do it and didn't hire someone to do it. So that's the cost of paying attention @NuWayCapital
Nothing like finishing out a tough day with two slices of my favorite pizza on Earth: Lazaro's on 17th and South in Philly. Pure joy.

What if Chip knows that the Panthers game on #MNF is a trap game, doesn't that make it less of a trap for the @Eagles ??
$BABA continues to gallop toward that $120 level where it would be valued about the same as $FB!
Getting ready to head over to the gala--CNBC's 25th!
